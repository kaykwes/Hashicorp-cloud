# Price Options for Key Vault, Hashicorp Cloud, and running personal Key Vault Server.
```shell
The cost difference between using Hashicorp cloud, Azure Key Vault, and running your key vault
server will depend on various factors such as the number of keys and secrets you need to store,
the level of security required, the number of users and applications that require access to 
the keys, and the amount of data transfer required.
```


# Hashicorp Cloud
```shell
Hashicorp Cloud is a cloud-based key management solution that provides secure storage and management of
cryptographic keys and secrets. In other words, with Hashicorp Cloud, you can store and manage keys 
and secrets in a secure, centralized location that is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
```


#  Azure Key Vault
```shell
Azure Key Vault is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft that allows you to securely store 
and manage cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates used for authentication and encryption 
in your applications and services.

Hashicorp Cloud and Azure Key Vault are both cloud-based key management solutions that offer
different pricing models based on usage.
```

# Here are some differences between the two Cloud services:
```shell
1. Provider: Hashicorp Cloud is provided by HashiCorp, a company that provides a suite of infrastructure 
management tools, while Azure Key Vault is provided by Microsoft as part of its Azure cloud services.

2. Features: Both services offer similar core features, such as secure key and secret storage, encryption, 
and access control, but they may differ in terms of additional features. For example, Hashicorp Cloud 
offers integration with its infrastructure management tools, while Azure Key Vault offers integration
with Azure Key Vault Managed HSM, which provides hardware security modules for higher levels of security.

3. Pricing: The pricing for both services can vary based on usage, with Hashicorp Cloud offering a 
pay-as-you-go pricing model and Azure Key Vault offering a pricing model based on the number of secrets and objects stored.

4. Community: Hashicorp Cloud has a large and active open-source community, which can be beneficial 
for developers who want to contribute to and benefit from open-source projects. Azure Key Vault also has 
an active community, but it may be more focused on enterprise customers who use Azure for their cloud infrastructure.
```

# Running your key vault server
```shell
Running your key vault server, on the other hand, involves setting up and maintaining a physical or 
virtual server on-premises or in the cloud, installing and configuring a key management software or 
solution, and managing the server and software yourself.


This can be a more complex and resource-intensive approach, but it provides greater control over the key 
management process and can be customized to meet specific requirements.
```

# The table below shows the differences between the 3 options based on the general cost-wise factors for running either one of them:
